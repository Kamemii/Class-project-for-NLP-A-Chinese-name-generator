# Class-project-for-NLP-A-Chinese-name-generator

## Introduction
This is class project for 24 Spring NLP in UPF. In this project I trained a character-based language model to generate Chinese person names.The training of this model was based on MLP neural network, and its quality was assessed using Negative Log-Likelihood, and also by manual evaluation.

## Instructions
